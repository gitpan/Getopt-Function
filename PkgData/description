Getopt::Function is an interface to Getopt::Mixed which is designed to 
make the option interface more easy to maintain.  In particular, it 
automatically builds up the --help description from option descriptions
which are kept in a hash alongside the actual option definitions.

It will be somewhat less efficient than Getopt::Mixed.  

The system supports long and short options etc. etc.
