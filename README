	Getopt::Function - interface to Getopt::Mixed based on
	function calls

*************************************************************************
This is an experimental alpha release.  All interfaces are subject to
change.  Little experience is available on the quality and reliability
of the software.
*************************************************************************

Getopt::Function is designed to provide a more sophisticated interface
to Getopt::Mixed.  It's key disadvantage is some more overhead.  It is
most suitable for use in large programs which have a large number of
complex options.  

Features:-	

	makes coding easier by simply storing options code in a hash

	makes documenting options automatic, in particular,
	--help/--usage,  --help-opt and --version functions are
	standard features.

I expect to have some interface to negative options (--no-delete as
opposed to --delete) via new symbols in the options list.  This part
of the interface should not interfere with the current interface
though. 

Obviously this package requres Getopt::Mixed to be installed to be
useful.  

This package is available uder the terms of the GNU Public
license.  Please see the file COPYING included.
